## Core Competencies 

* You can own and execute tasks independently and debug easy-medium problems fairly independently.
* You also tackle hard problems on your own and try to get some early hints and then as needed seek help from a senior engineer from your team or from your larger engineering organization/other teams etc.
* Conversely, you are also willing to extend help to other engineers in debugging/solving an issue in an area that you may have worked on in the past.
* You own small features/areas of a system entirely and gain mastery and depth in those areas. You are the person to go to for solving issues in that small sub-system/feature set that you own.
* You are learning to do code review and trying to get proficient at it while learning to be respectful, thoughtful, and not being too pedantic.
* You are continuously scanning the code/systems that you work with to identify areas that can be improved. You are learning to do this better and when you find something worth improving, you talk to the team and customer and try to take it to a logical conclusion.
* For every work item you finish/work on in a given day/week, you also spend time understanding the larger context around that work area and the technology used. 
* You understand that most problems in our technology space are multi-disciplinary and involve multiple layers of the stack. Whenever possible you work ahead of the tasks to identify and read/learn about those areas and be prepared with your plan of action.
* You work towards building a broad understanding of a few areas and trying to build a deeper understanding of 1-3 areas (broad is the horizontal bar & depth is the vertical bar in the T-shaped skills).

## Functional Competencies 

### Management 
  * You are able to interact with customers and team members independently in a clear and articulate manner.
  * You can derive rough estimates of a task with some variation in accuracy and are working on improving it. You understand to a decent degree tasks which need some buffer and tasks which are clearly on a risk-free path.
  * You work to understand not just the task at hand but also what the user/customer is trying to achieve and ensure that underlying value is delivered, not just the task.
  * You are able to understand priorities between multiple tasks and actively communicate to stakeholders if there is any change needed or any delays that happen.
### Delighting People
  * You seek feedback and work on action items together with an experienced member of the team.
  * You under-commit and over-deliver on tasks while ensuring quality.
  * You are able to explain and articulate the value of certain choices done in work and their impact on systems in the short and medium term.
  * You are mentoring at least 1-2 associate engineers - from your experiences of learning and building things. You are happy to jump onto a pair debugging session once in a while to help them think and learn better.
### Organization Building
  * You start participating in interviews and are learning the art of interviewing by asking questions to other experienced interviewers. You also start doing a few interviews under the guidance of an experienced interviewer and learn from those.
  * You start contributing, at least once a quarter to one of the activities such as writing a blog or giving a talk about a specific problem you solved at the internal meetup. You may not be very good at it, but you are learning and getting better at it. You also realize that these activities are not just for “I wrote N blogs to meet criteria for my next role” but they actually make you think and present etc. - which makes you a better engineer and actually helps you level up.
### Social Capital
  * You actively participate in community-level activities and initiatives such as meetups, conferences and social causes.
  * You actively participate & attend the meetups etc. You give a shot at contributing, by giving a talk or being part of an organizing committee.

## Behavioral Competencies
### Enabling Traits

* **Tenacity**: A lot of times the required work/task at hand would need you to dig deep and not give up. We would expect you to do that.
* **Love for technology**: You love to learn and understand new things and go to the depth of knowledge of things you know. You are constantly on the lookout for better ways to do the same thing. In some cases, it could be a new cool tech or tool but in most cases, it is a better approach or refactoring to a better design. You care to learn and differentiate this and are constantly learning new things.
* **Maker and breaker**: You love tinkering with things and trying things out. You build and break things and that is how you learn to get stuff done.
* **Continuous improvement**: You have a fairly good understanding of areas you are excellent, good and average at and are working to improve on the good and average areas. This is something you regularly discuss with your mentor who is experienced and has been there and done that.
* **Connected InfraCloud core values**: Being Resourceful & Being Ahead of the Curve
