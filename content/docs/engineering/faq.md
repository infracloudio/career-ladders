<!-- 1. **Who all under engineering organization are covered under Career Laddering?**   -->
<!--    The engineering career laddering is applicable to Product/SRE/QE/Security Engineers in the Organization. -->

1. **Will staff engineers be taking care of multiple projects?**  
   In large customer projects - staff will do this collaboration between entities of customer teams. In smaller ones, staff could handle multiple projects from InfraCloud.

1. **Will all projects be led by staff and principal engineers?**  
   Yes & No. There will be at least one staff/principal engineer associated with every project. They may or may not be actively contributing to the project depending on the size of the project. This ensures that every Infranaut has a mentor who knows/understands the work being delivered on the ground for an effective feedback loop. Also, the staff/principal engineer will be responsible for the general health of the project and will work closely with the project team to set up best practices.


<!-- 1. **Can an Infranaut skip a level?**   -->
<!--    The technical chops plays an important role here & need mastery over time. Hence, one has to go through the journey at each level.  -->


<!-- Q7: Do the framework/criteria will consequently become performance goals to be defined for each level in the progression ladder, or this is separate from the existing performance goals we currently have? -->

<!-- Ans 7:  It will not 100% replace performance management - but you can see a good overlap in performance management metrics and these like org building, delighting people etc. And within the core - there are sub-points like communication etc. So in a way, this is more like an implementation of the same with better clarity on roles & responsibilities at each level. The next steps will be to define KPI at the project level by Principle Engineers & Staff Engineers  -->

<!-- Q9: Do all the promotions require open roles? e.g. someone moving from ASRE to SRE - does not really need an open role correct? -->

<!-- Ans 9: That is correct, a movement from ASRE to SRE doesnâ€™t require an open role. This movement will be effected based on demonstrated capabilities of the next role (and will happen mostly during annual appraisal cycles). Demonstrating the capabilities of the next role is a prerequisite for any promotion - however, for other promotions, additional criteria will include business growth as well.  -->

<!-- Q13: It would be good to define the years of experience for each level, for someone to get promoted to the next level. Also if it is fine for someone gets promoted early because they outperform others at the same level or show the capability to be at the next level. -->

<!-- Ans 13: Though we have added indicative numbers in individual descriptions - they are not hard values. We don't want to constrain Infranaut who can move fast - to not move fast. -->

<!-- Q14: We can think of naming the Technical Project Manager as Engineering Manager (If we are planning to have a similar ROR for TPM. but i see that TPM roles are yet to be defined)  -->

<!-- Ans 14: Engineering Manager designation typically deals with specific areas/departments within a wider engineering org. TPM usually is associated with specific projects within the area/departments. As of now, we are rolling out TPM roles and will evolve the PM org over time as we grow. -->

<!-- 1. **When do we refer to career laddering?**   -->
<!--   Career Laddering can be referred to at any point in time to know a detailed understanding of the role.   -->
<!--   Eg1: A new Infranaut to read and discuss with a mentor in the first 30 days of On-boarding   -->
<!--   Eg 2: Need role clarity   -->
<!--   Eg 3: When the Career Laddering rollout is new or each time when its updated   -->
<!--   Eg 4. If there is an opportunity to change tracks -->
