Career Ladder is a progression framework within [InfraCloud](https://www.infracloud.io/). It highlights different levels within InfraCloud and the key competencies required at each of the levels. The document aims to provide a framework for [Infranaut’s](# "We call InfraCloud employees Infranauts") growth and developmental roadmap.

### Key objectives
* Describe competencies across different levels in the organization.
* Codify and present how roles and responsibilities progress across levels.
* Guide to your professional development plans.

## About this website
We are open sourcing the career ladders used at InfraCloud for everyone. Our career ladders are designed to cover the additional skills needed to be a consultant. You can use this as a starting point to build career ladders for your own organization. Each organization is unique, so we encourage you to modify our career ladders to suit your needs. 

A lot of inspiration for this work came from:
* Sarah Dresner’s framework <https://career-ladders.dev/engineering>
* Some good inputs from [Medium’s Growth Rubrik framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EO-Dbsayn8Nz9Ii3MKcwRbt-EIJ2MjQdpoyhh0tBdZk/edit#gid=2049640133)
