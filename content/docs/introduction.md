Each level has been broken down across two broad buckets, Professional Competencies and Behavioral Competencies.

### Professional Competencies
Professional Competencies focus on fundamental aspects of the work and technical competency expected at the level of role you are performing.

These are further divided into Core Competencies and Functional Competencies (subdivided into Management, Organization Building, Delighting People, and Social Capital).

#### Core Competencies
The core focuses on the fundamental aspects of the work and technical competency expected at the level of role one is performing at.

#### Functional Competencies 
* **Management**  
  Every role involves some amount of management - from your own tasks, and teamâ€™s responsibilities to managing customers. This section outlines responsibilities at the level of the role one is performing at.
* **Organization Building**  
  Everything you do helps build an organization in various ways. Some ways are more explicit and some are implicit. This section outlines how this changes as you progress through your career at InfraCloud.
* **Delighting People**  
  A large part of our work involves working with people very closely and collaborating. This section outlines responsibilities at the level of the role one is performing at.
* **Social Capital**  
  Whatever you do has an impact within the organization of the course, but for a long-term view, we need to build social capital outside org too. This could be by dedicating our energies to the community or being a person who helps others by sharing their knowledge outside. This part will talk about responsibilities at the level of the role one is performing at.

### Behavioral Competencies
Behavioral Competencies comprise a list of Enabling Traits and they act as a building block to progress on Professional Competencies.

* **Enabling Traits**  
  This is a section which will list traits that makes one successful in the role they are in.

### Broad Indicators
This section gives a rough split of responsibilities and any other data point based on anecdote/experience.
